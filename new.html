		<h1>Quick hummus recipe</h1>
		<p>
			This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been
			adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the
			years.
		</p>
		<p>
			Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle
			Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta
			breads.
		</p>

		<h2>Ingredients</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</li>
			<li>175g of tahini</li>
			<li>6 sundried tomatoes</li>
			<li>Half a red pepper</li>
			<li>A pinch of cayenne pepper</li>
			<li>1 clove of garlic</li>
			<li>A dash of olive oil</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Instructions</h2>

		<ol>
			<li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely</li>
			<li>
				Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop
				coarsely
			</li>
			<li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor</li>
			<li>
				Process all the ingredients into a paste.
				<ul>
					<li>
						If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a
						short time
					</li>
					<li>
						If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer
						time
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ol>

		<p>
			For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure
			of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and
			mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for
			you.
		</p>

		<h2>Storage</h2>

		<p>
			Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be
			able to use it for about a week after you've made it. If it starts
			to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.
		</p>

		<p>
			Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it
			within a couple of months.
